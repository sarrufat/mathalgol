# Highly composite numbers
A **highly composite number**, sometimes called an **antiprime** number, is a positive integer with more divisors than any smaller positive integer has.

## Build
run 'make build'

## Run
*./hcompnum -n ###### -par*  
Where ###### is the top numbe

The -par flag activates the parallel optimization that outperforms the non-parallel one about 95% performance for each additional CPU.


### Example
 *./hcompnum -n 10000000000 -par*
 
Will generate the firsts 76 HCNs up to *76 -> 6983776800, 2304 div.*
